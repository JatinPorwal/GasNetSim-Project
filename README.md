# **GasNetSim**

*GasNetSim* is a simulation package designed for gas network steady-state simulation. 
It supports the steady-state natural gas network simulations with different gas mixture
compositions, thus enabling accurate analysis of the impacts of hydrogen injection on the gas network.  
Moreover, users have the flexibility to modify this tool and implement their own desired
gas mixture modeling approaches.
Future work will be carried out to include gas storage units and to take into account 
the dynamic behavior of the gas network so that short-term simulations can be performed.

## Installation
Currently, it is only supported using source files.
